  <p class="fade drop-cap">For Kaelyn Brown, many of the kids at Science Club for Girls remind her of her younger self.</p>
  <p class="fade">A Massachusetts resident for most of her life, Brown has been a member of Cambridge-based <a href="https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/">Science Club for Girls (SCFG)</a> since she was 6-years-old when she started out as a participant. Now, as a 25-year-old, she serves as a mentor for kids who come from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
  <p class="fade">“It’s so amazing to be able to give back a little bit to an organization that’s given me so much as a child,” said Brown, a first-year medical student at Harvard Medical School. “[SCFG] has really helped shape my own identity as a scientist, as a Black woman who’s also a scientist.”</p>
  <p class="fade">The gender and race disparity in STEM is still noticeable among Gen Z. According to a March 2024 report by the <a href="https://ngcproject.org/sites/default/files/downloadables/2024-02/NGCP-TheStateofGirlsinSTEM-March2024.pdf">National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP)</a>, women earn half of the degrees in Science & Engineering (S&E), despite earning 58% of bachelor's degree in all fields. Furthermore, while Latina, Black and Indigenous women make up 17% of the total U.S. population, they earn 14% of bachelor's degrees in STEM fields.</p>

  <p class="fade">“That is a harsh reality that a lot of kids who are underrepresented in STEM face,” Brown said. “That really shakes your confidence.”</p>

      <p>SCFG was formed in 1994 when two Cambridge moms decided to create a STEM organization with diversity and equity at its core values, said Bonnie Bertolaet, executive director of SCFG. Specifically, the organization would provide educational opportunities and women mentors for young BIPOC girls and non-binary individuals. Today, the organization serves more than “700 girls and gender-expansive youth in grades K-12 through in-person and virtual programs in Greater Boston and surrounding communities,” according to SCFG’s <a href="https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/">website</a>.</p>

  <p class="fade">Brown and her family first heard about the program through a friend from church. Her mom signed her and her sister up. Brown stayed through the program from elementary school to high school and became a mentor when she attended Harvard University. She was the director of the Harvard Chapter of SCFG and continued being a mentor after graduating in 2021.</p>
  <p class="fade">“It’s been really fulfilling to see young kids who maybe one day want to go to medical school or maybe one day are interested in science and being able to tell them, ‘This is what I do and you could do this too,’” Brown said.</p>

    <div class="flow-text-container fade">
      <p>The club meets after school and on Saturdays, providing programs both in person at schools or virtually. They operate on a schedule aligned with fall and spring semesters, each focusing on different STEM disciplines, with brief summer sessions also offered. This semester, SCFG is holding its biotechnology curriculum, developed by mentor Ashley Cooper, who previously served as the co-president of the Harvard chapter with Brown.</p>

  <p class="fade">A September 2023 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/544772/stem-gender-gaps-significant-among-gen.aspx">Gallup survey</a> found that among 12- to 26-year-olds, there was a higher interest in STEM careers among boys and men than girls and women, who lacked confidence in their abilities. 63% of female respondents were interested in at least one related field, while the figure stood at 85% for male respondents.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="fade">However, increased enrollment for SCFG says otherwise. Since 2018, enrollment has increased by 360%, according to the website. While the club itself is free, interested participants must fill out an application. SCFG currently has a waitlist.</p>
  <blockquote class="fade">“We don’t really have to recruit our participants,” Bertolaet said. “So this idea that girls are not interested in STEM is really a fallacy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="fade">SCFG prioritizes hands-on activities and doesn’t require its participants to take exams. Brown recalled that when she was 10 years old, SCFG brought her to Merck Pharmaceuticals where she listened to graduate students presenting their research. One neuroscientist in particular presented her research on rats.</p>
  <p class="fade">“That really inspired me to want to become a neuroscientist and major in neuroscience in college,” Brown said.
  <p class="fade">SCFG’s programs have nearly 200 volunteer mentors, ranging from high schoolers to seasoned professionals, who provide participants with “personal examples of self-confidence, STEM excellence, and above all, a sense of joy and sisterhood in STEM,” the website said. “I think that’s really powerful,” Cooper said. “It’s more motivating than if you see someone who's much older than you. A different feeling of making sure that they know they can achieve their goals.”</p>

  <p class="fade">Brown said being a participant was a “very formative experience that shaped my identity” and others who were in the organization with her.</p>
  <p class="fade">“A lot of the people I know who were in the clubs are now in science fields,” Brown said.</p>
  <p class="fade">In the last 14 years, over 90% of SCFG juniors and seniors in high school have gone on to college with over 55% majoring in STEM, according to the <a href="https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/impact">website</a>. Meanwhile, in the last three years, 100% go on to college with 86% majoring in STEM.</p>
  <p class="fade">More than 80% of SCFG’s participants come from three different groups that are underrepresented in STEM by race, family income, or first in their family to go to college, Bertolaet said. Additionally, over 60% of its mentors come from those same communities.</p>
  <p class="fade">“I think that’s why programs like this are so important,” Brown said. “They give kids who may not have other opportunities to engage in science, but also to meet people who look like them, who are doing things that they may want to do in the future and learn about things that they could do in the future.”</p>
  <p class="fade">SCFG is looking to expand within the next three years by admitting more participants each semester and looking beyond the Greater Boston area, said Bertolaet. Ultimately, SCFG hopes to show more folks from underrepresented backgrounds “what a life in STEM looks like in Massachusetts” and how SCFG could contribute to the future of STEM, Brown said.</p>
  <p class="fade">“[SCFG gave me] confidence in myself, in my identity as a scientist, my identity as a Black woman, and in my ability to make a change and contribute to the scientific community,” Brown said.</p>
